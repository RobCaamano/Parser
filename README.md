# Simple-Parser
Parser for a simple programming language

The parser should provide the following:

1: The results of an unsuccessful parsing are a set of error messages printed by the parser functions, as well as the error messages that might be detected by the lexical analyzer

2: If the parser fails, the program should stop after the parser function returns
